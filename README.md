Some flash utilities for the XMOS StartKit

Description: This is a small utility meant to run with the debug interface to view the status of the flash images in the flash for the XMOS StartKit. It uses the debug interface to show the images found in flash. This utility should be capable of being used with other boards. I am also going to add more commands as it is a work in progress.
